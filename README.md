# Live Data Dive: Apache Kafka® Clients and Processing Data Streams
### Presentation: [{ YOUR PRESENTATION NAME }](workshop/presentation_template.pdf)

## Workshop description
During the workshop you will learn how to set up a Kafka producer client, then process the data to make it ready for downstream consumers (which you will also learn how to use). We will also discuss the basic of Kafka and get a handle on the different ways to process the data. 

## Requirements
* PyLadies Amsterdam uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
* Google account if you want to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
 
## Usage
### with uv
Run the following code:
```bash
git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
cd <name-of-repo>

# create and activate venv, install dependencies
uv sync
```
### with Google collab
1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. In the top left corner select "File" &#8594; "Open Notebook"
3. Under "GitHub", enter the URL of the repo of this workshop
4. Select one of the notebooks within the repo.
5. At the top of the notebook, add a Code cell and run the following code:
```bash
!git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
%cd <name-of-repo>
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### for a workshop giver
To get started, open the `pyproject.toml` file and set the required Python version. The pre-selected version 3.8 is generally a safe choice for most use cases.

After you have specified the Python version, you can create a virtual environment with `uv venv` and add packages with `uv add <package>`. Before the workshop, you can generate a requirements.txt file, which is needed e.g. for running code in GoogleColab, by running `uv export > requirements.txt`.

## Appendix
### Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure our code looks beautiful, PyLadies uses pre-commit hooks. You can enable them by running `pre-commit install`. You may have to install `pre-commit` first, using `uv sync`, `uv pip install pre-commit` or `pip install pre-commit`.

Happy Coding :)
